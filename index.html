  <section id="domestic-directions">
    <h2>🚆 Domestic Directions</h2>
    <p><strong>By Train/Tube:</strong> The nearest station is <strong>London Victoria</strong> (a 7-minute walk). Exit the station toward Vauxhall Bridge Road. Turn left on Vauxhall Bridge Rd and walk about 7 minutes to reach <strong>195 Vauxhall Bridge Road</strong> (the house is on the left-hand side).</p>
    <p><strong>By Car:</strong> Driving is <u>not recommended</u> as we have no on-site parking. Street parking is very limited in central London and the area is within the Congestion Charge zone. If you must drive, you’ll need to use a nearby public parking garage (e.g. at Victoria Station) and pay hourly or daily fees.</p>
    <p><strong>By Taxi/Rideshare:</strong> Use “195 Vauxhall Bridge Road, London SW1V” as your destination. Taxis and Ubers can drop you off right at our doorstep.</p>

  <section id="getting-around">
    <h2>🚇 Getting Around</h2>
    <p><strong>Public Transportation:</strong> London’s transit is excellent. <strong>Victoria Station</strong> (Underground lines: Victoria, District, Circle; plus National Rail trains and coaches) is a 7-minute walk away and connects you to all of London and beyond.</p>
    <p><strong>Buses:</strong> Several bus routes stop near the house. The famous <strong>Route 24</strong> bus (a great scenic route through central London) has a stop just outside our door. Buses are an easy way to reach nearby attractions if you prefer not to walk.</p>
    <p><strong>Contactless Payments:</strong> You can pay for the Tube, buses, and trains with a simple tap of a contactless credit/debit card (or Oyster card). Fares automatically cap daily, so you get the best rate without needing a paper travelcard.</p>
    <p><strong>Other Options:</strong> London offers rideshare services (Uber, Bolt) and there are Santander Cycles (public hire bicycles) nearby if you’d like to bike. You can even catch a Thames river boat from Westminster or Millbank Pier (around £10, also payable by contactless) for a scenic trip.</p>
    <p>📱 <em>Tip:</em> Download the <strong>Citymapper</strong> app (or use Google Maps) to navigate public transit like a local.</p>
