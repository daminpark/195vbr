    <!-- WHAT NOT TO BRING -->
    <section id="what-not-to-bring">
      <h2>🚫 What not to bring</h2>
      <p>We provide a variety of amenities, so you can pack light! Here are some things you <em>don’t</em> need to bring:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Towels &amp; Linens:</strong> Fresh bath towels and bed linens are provided for every guest.</li>
        <li><strong>Toiletries:</strong> Shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and hand soap are available in the bathrooms.</li>
        <li><strong>Hair Dryers:</strong> A hairdryer is provided in each bedroom.</li>
        <li><strong>Adapters &amp; Chargers:</strong> Every room has universal power adapters and USB-C/USB-A ports on either side of the bed, so you can just bring cables.</li>
        <li><strong>Extra Blankets:</strong> All beds have an electric underblanket.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- DOMESTIC DIRECTIONS -->
    <section id="domestic-directions">
      <h2>🚶 Domestic directions</h2>
      <p><strong>By Train/Tube:</strong> The house is a short 7-minute walk from <strong>London Victoria Station</strong>, which is a major hub for the Underground, national rail, and coaches. If you arrive at Victoria, take the exit toward Victoria Street/Vauxhall Bridge Road. Once outside, turn left onto Vauxhall Bridge Road and walk straight for about 5–7 minutes. The house will be on your left.</p>
      <p><strong>By Coach:</strong> If you arrive at Victoria Coach Station, it’s about a 10-minute walk. Head east on Elizabeth Street toward Buckingham Palace Road, then continue toward Victoria Station and onto Vauxhall Bridge Road.</p>
      <p><strong>By Car/Taxi:</strong> Note that we do not have on-site parking. If driving, you may need to find a public parking garage nearby (and be mindful of London’s congestion charges) - you can try using Parkopedia to find parking. Taxis and rideshares will easily find the address using the postcode.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- AIRPORT DIRECTIONS -->
    <section id="airport-directions">
      <h2>✈️ Airport directions</h2>
      <p>You can book buses on <a href="https://www.nationalexpress.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nationalexpress.com</a>, and trains on <a href="https://www.thetrainline.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trainline.com</a>.<br>
      If you are more than 2 people, you can consider taking a rideshare like Uber or Bolt, it might work out cheaper.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Gatwick (LGW):</strong><br>
      We recommend a train as it goes directly to Victoria – trains run every 10 minutes, takes 30 minutes, and costs around 15 pounds one way. You can tap in and tap out using a contactless card (no need to buy a ticket).<br>
      You can take a Southern Rail train rather than Gatwick Express - the difference in time is 5 minutes and it is much cheaper. Please be aware the train goes to the South Terminal, and you must leave some more time to transfer to the North Terminal (around 15 minutes extra).</p>

      <p><strong>Stansted (STN):</strong><br>
      We recommend the train to Tottenham Hale, and change to the Victoria line to Victoria. Please be aware you cannot use contactless from Stansted – you must buy a ticket.</p>

      <p><strong>Luton (LTN):</strong><br>
      Take the train from Luton Airport Parkway to London St. Pancras (around 40 minutes), then transfer to the Victoria Line Underground to Victoria Station (~15 minutes). Alternatively, coach services run from Luton directly to Victoria Coach Station (around 1 hour 15 minutes).</p>

      <p><strong>Heathrow (LHR):</strong><br>
      Take the London Underground – Piccadilly Line (dark blue) from Heathrow and change at Hammersmith for the District Line (green) to Victoria Station. Travel time is around 50 minutes.    </section>

    <!-- GETTING AROUND -->
    <section id="getting-around">
      <h2>🚇 Getting Around</h2>
      <p>Public transportation is excellent in London. Victoria Station (a 7-minute walk away) is a major transport hub for the Underground, trains, and buses. There are also local bus stops just outside our door that go to popular tourist areas. (Insider tip: the <strong>24 bus</strong> route, which stops near the house, doubles as a cheaper sightseeing tour through central London!)</p>
      <p>You can pay for all public transit with just a tap of a contactless credit or debit card. Fares are capped daily, so you’ll automatically get the best rate by the end of the day without needing to buy a special day pass.</p>
      <p>London is very walkable and also has public bicycle hire stations nearby if you want to cycle. You can even take a scenic <strong>Thames river bus</strong> (ferry) from a pier near Westminster — about £10 one way, and you can use contactless for that as well.</p>

    <!-- CHECK-IN & LUGGAGE DROP-OFF -->
    <section id="check-in-luggage">
      <h2>🧳 Check-In &amp; Luggage Drop-Off</h2>
      <p><strong>Self Check-in:</strong> Check-in time is 3:00 PM (or anytime after). We operate a self check-in system, so there’s no need to wait for anyone to meet you.</p>
      <p><strong>Luggage Drop-off:</strong> You can leave bags at the house from 11:00. You may store luggage downstairs in cupboard V. Please message me the day before check-in if you need an earlier dropoff before check-in (subject to availability).</p>
    </section>

    <!-- EARLY CHECK-IN -->
    <section id="early-check-in">
      <h2>⏰ Early check-in (PLEASE READ IF YOU REALLY NEED THIS)</h2>
      <p>If you do arrive early in the day, the best approach is to take advantage of our luggage drop-off option (see above). You can leave your bags with us in the morning, go enjoy the city, and return after 3 PM when your room is ready.</p>
      <p>Check-in is at 15:00, if you enter at this time, we guarantee the room is clean and your things will not be thrown away. The earliest you can enter your room/bathroom is at 12:00. HOWEVER, it is unlikely your room is ready by this time. If you see that the room is not ready/clean yet, please do not enter and please do not leave your things in there – the cleaners may throw away your things as they think the previous guests have left them, and will also mean the cleaners cannot clean properly and result in an unclean room. Please do not store anything in the bathroom or kitchen before 15:00, as the cleaners empty out the fridge/food/bathroom compartments during the hours of 11:00–15:00.</p>
