    <section id="what-not-to-bring">
      <h2>What Not to Bring</h2>
      <p>We provide a variety of amenities, so you can pack light! Here are some things you <em>don’t</em> need to bring:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Towels &amp; Linens:</strong> Fresh bath towels and bed linens are provided for every guest.</li>
        <li><strong>Toiletries:</strong> Shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and hand soap are available in the bathrooms.</li>
        <li><strong>Hair Dryers:</strong> A hairdryer is provided in each bedroom.</li>
        <li><strong>Adapters &amp; Chargers:</strong> Every room has universal power adapters and USB-C, Lightning (iPhone), and Micro-USB chargers, so you can charge your devices without bringing extra plugs.</li>
        <li><strong>Extra Blankets:</strong> All beds have an electric underblanket, and we can provide additional blankets if needed.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="domestic-directions">
      <h2>Domestic Directions</h2>
      <p><strong>By Train/Tube:</strong> The house is a short 7-minute walk from <strong>London Victoria Station</strong>, which is a major hub for the Underground, national rail, and coaches. If you arrive at Victoria, take the exit toward Victoria Street/Vauxhall Bridge Road. Once outside, turn left onto Vauxhall Bridge Road and walk straight for about 5–7 minutes. The house (195 Vauxhall Bridge Road) will be on your left.</p>
      <p><strong>By Coach:</strong> If you arrive at Victoria Coach Station, it’s about a 10-minute walk. Head east on Elizabeth Street toward Buckingham Palace Road, then continue toward Victoria Station and onto Vauxhall Bridge Road.</p>
      <p><strong>By Car/Taxi:</strong> Use the address “195 Vauxhall Bridge Road, SW1V 1ER, London.” Note that we do not have on-site parking. If driving, you may need to find a public parking garage nearby (and be mindful of London’s congestion charges). Taxis and rideshares will easily find the address using the postcode.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="airport-directions">
      <h2>Airport Directions</h2>
      <p>We are well-connected to all major London airports. Typical travel times: ~30 minutes from Gatwick, ~50 minutes from Heathrow, ~1 hour from Stansted or Luton.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Heathrow (LHR):</strong> Take the London Underground – Piccadilly Line (dark blue) from Heathrow and change at Hammersmith (or Barons Court) for the District Line (green) to Victoria Station. Travel time is around 50 minutes. Alternatively, you can take the Heathrow Express train to Paddington Station and then a taxi or the Underground to Victoria.</li>
        <li><strong>Gatwick (LGW):</strong> Take the Gatwick Express train direct to Victoria Station (around 30 minutes). This is the fastest option. (Southern Rail trains and National Express coaches also connect Gatwick to Victoria.)</li>
        <li><strong>Stansted (STN):</strong> Take the Stansted Express train to Tottenham Hale (about 35 minutes), then switch to the Victoria Line (light blue Underground line) toward Brixton and get off at Victoria. Total journey ~1 hour. Alternatively, National Express coaches run from Stansted to Victoria Coach Station (about 1 hour 30 minutes).</li>
        <li><strong>Luton (LTN):</strong> Take the train from Luton Airport Parkway to London St. Pancras (around 40 minutes), then transfer to the Victoria Line Underground to Victoria Station (~15 minutes). Alternatively, coach services run from Luton directly to Victoria Coach Station (around 1 hour 15 minutes).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="getting-around">
      <h2>Getting Around</h2>
      <p>Public transportation is excellent in London. Victoria Station (a 7-minute walk away) is a major transport hub for the Underground, trains, and buses. There are also local bus stops just outside our door that go to popular tourist areas. (Insider tip: the <strong>24 bus</strong> route, which stops near the house, doubles as a cheaper sightseeing tour through central London!)</p>
      <p>You can pay for all public transit with just a tap of a contactless credit or debit card. Fares are capped daily, so you’ll automatically get the best rate by the end of the day without needing to buy a special day pass.</p>
      <p>London is very walkable and also has public bicycle hire stations nearby if you want to cycle. You can even take a scenic <strong>Thames river bus</strong> (ferry) from a pier near Westminster — about £10 one way, and you can use contactless for that as well.</p>
      <p>For navigation, smartphone apps like <strong>Citymapper</strong> or Google Maps are extremely helpful to plan your routes around the city.</p>

    <section id="check-in-luggage-drop-off">
      <h2>Check-in &amp; Luggage Drop-off</h2>
      <p><strong>Self Check-in:</strong> Check-in time is 3:00 PM (or anytime after). We operate a self check-in system, so there’s no need to wait for anyone to meet you. On the day of your arrival, we will send you detailed check-in instructions and your entry code around late morning or noon. You can let yourself in anytime after 3 PM with that code.</p>
      <p><strong>Luggage Drop-off:</strong> If you arrive in London before the 3 PM check-in time, you can usually drop off your luggage earlier. Please message us in advance to arrange this. We’ll let you know where to securely leave your bags until your room is ready. This way, you can start exploring the city without being weighed down. (Note: while we’re happy to hold your bags and you may find the common areas in use, the rooms themselves won’t be accessible until they’ve been cleaned and prepared.)</p>
      <p><strong>Check-out:</strong> Check-out time is 11:00 AM. Unfortunately, we cannot offer late check-outs, as we need time to prepare for the next guests. However, if you have a later departure from London, let us know — we may be able to hold your luggage for a few hours after check-out so you can enjoy your final day hands-free.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="kitchen-rules">
      <h2>Kitchen Rules</h2>
      <p>Our kitchen is a shared space for all guests. To keep it clean and comfortable for everyone, please follow these guidelines:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal Storage:</strong> Each room has its own designated refrigerator section and cabinet space. Please use only your assigned spaces for storing food.</li>
        <li><strong>Clean Up After Yourself:</strong> Wash any dishes, utensils, or cookware you use and put them back once you’re done. Wipe down the counters and leave the kitchen as you found it, so it’s ready for the next person.</li>
        <li><strong>Shared Supplies:</strong> We provide complimentary tea and coffee (Nespresso pods) for you. Feel free to use basic condiments and spices in the kitchen, but be considerate and leave some for other guests.</li>
        <li><strong>Respect Quiet Hours:</strong> If you’re cooking late in the evening or early in the morning, keep noise to a minimum so as not to disturb others sleeping nearby.</li>
        <li><strong>No Food in Rooms:</strong> Please enjoy your meals in the kitchen or dining area, rather than in the bedrooms. This helps avoid spills, crumbs, and unwelcome pests in sleeping areas.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="laundry">
      <h2>Laundry</h2>
      <p>There is a washing machine and dryer available for guest use (located in the basement). However, these machines are primarily used for our housekeeping (laundering linens), so <strong>guest laundry is only available in the evenings and by request.</strong> If you need to do laundry during your stay, just let us know and we’ll arrange a time after our cleaning schedule (usually after 6 PM) when you can use the machines.</p>
      <p>We can provide laundry detergent and softener. Please only run the washer/dryer after we’ve confirmed the timing, to ensure it doesn’t conflict with our cleaning team’s use. (If you prefer or need daytime service, there’s also a laundromat on Wilton Road, a short walk away.)</p>
    </section>

    <section id="tv-instructions">
      <h2>TV Instructions</h2>
      <p>Each bedroom is equipped with a Smart 4K TV loaded with popular streaming apps (Disney+, Apple TV+, Amazon Prime Video, BBC iPlayer, etc.). Here’s how to make the most of it:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Power &amp; Input:</strong> Use the TV remote in your room to turn on the television. It should go straight to the home menu of the smart TV interface (no need to change HDMI inputs).</li>
        <li><strong>Streaming Apps:</strong> Navigate the on-screen menu with the remote. Select the app you want (e.g., Disney+ or Prime Video) and press OK/Enter. We’ve provided access to several streaming services for you to enjoy. (Live local channels are also available via Freeview on the TV.)</li>
        <li><strong>Logging In/Out:</strong> If you wish to log into any of your personal streaming accounts (like Netflix), you’re welcome to do so. Just remember to log out of your accounts before you check out, for your privacy. Please do not log out of any of the pre-configured apps/accounts that we’ve set up.</li>
        <li><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong> If an app freezes or the internet connection drops on the TV, try turning the TV off and on again. This usually resets the connection. Feel free to contact us if you encounter any issues with the TV.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="early-check-in-details">
      <h2>Early Check-in Details</h2>
      <p>We understand some guests arrive in London very early. While we wish we could let everyone into their rooms immediately, our cleaning team needs time to prepare rooms between guests. This means we typically cannot guarantee access to your room before the standard 3 PM check-in time.</p>
      <p>If you do arrive early in the day, the best approach is to take advantage of our luggage drop-off option (see above). You can leave your bags with us in the morning, go enjoy the city, and return after 3 PM when your room is ready.</p>
      <p>Occasionally, if the room was unoccupied the night before, we might be able to arrange an earlier check-in. Feel free to ask us, but please understand it’s not always possible. If an early check-in is essential for you (for example, if you have an early morning flight and need to rest), the only way to guarantee that is to book the previous night as well, so the room is free and ready when you arrive.</p>
      <p>Communication is key – let us know your arrival plans, and we’ll do our best to accommodate. We want to make your check-in as smooth as possible!</p>

      <h2>Local Guidebook (Restaurants &amp; Sights)</h2>
      <p>To help you make the most of our neighborhood, we’ve compiled a few of our favorite nearby restaurants and attractions. All are within walking distance or a quick ride from the house:</p>
      <h3>Recommended Restaurants &amp; Cafés</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Queen’s Arms:</strong> A classic British pub just around the corner, known for its cozy atmosphere, great ales, and a tasty Sunday roast. Perfect for an evening pint or a traditional pub meal.</li>
        <li><strong>Cacio &amp; Pepe (Italian):</strong> A popular local Italian trattoria on Churton Street. They serve authentic pasta (their namesake cheese and pepper pasta is excellent) and other Italian favorites in a warm, friendly setting.</li>
        <li><strong>Pimlico Fresh:</strong> A charming café offering hearty breakfasts, brunch, and fresh juices. It’s excellent for a morning coffee or an English breakfast to start your day.</li>
        <li><strong>About Thyme:</strong> A highly-rated European bistro on Wilton Road. They offer a seasonal menu of British and Mediterranean dishes – great for a nice dinner out with a relaxed, upscale vibe.</li>
        <li><strong>Tachbrook Street Market:</strong> (Weekdays &amp; Sat daytime) A local street market with various food stalls and fresh produce. Great for grabbing a quick lunch or browsing local vendors. It’s a true neighborhood gem, just a short walk away.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Nearby Sights &amp; Attractions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Buckingham Palace:</strong> The King’s official London residence is only about a 15-minute walk away. Don’t miss the Changing of the Guard ceremony (around 11 AM on scheduled days), and enjoy a stroll through St. James’s Park next door.</li>
        <li><strong>Westminster Abbey &amp; Big Ben:</strong> Walk ~20 minutes (or take a quick bus/tube) to reach Westminster Abbey – the historic coronation church – and the Houses of Parliament with the iconic Big Ben clock tower. This area is the heart of London’s royal and governmental history.</li>
        <li><strong>Tate Britain:</strong> One of London’s premier art museums (free entry) is about a 15-minute walk south across Vauxhall Bridge. You can see British artworks from Turner to Hockney. The stroll along the Thames to get there is lovely, too.</li>
        <li><strong>Westminster Cathedral:</strong> Often overlooked, this stunning neo-Byzantine cathedral (not to be confused with the Abbey) is just 5 minutes from the house, near Victoria station. You can tour inside and even take an elevator up the bell tower for great views of the city.</li>
        <li><strong>Victoria Palace &amp; Apollo Victoria Theatres:</strong> For West End shows close by, these two theaters (5–10 minutes away) host big musicals. The Victoria Palace is home to “Hamilton” and the Apollo Victoria hosts “Wicked.” If you’re interested in seeing a show, consider booking tickets in advance.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Of course, London has endless things to do. These are just a few highlights in our area to get you started. If you need more recommendations or directions, just ask — we’re happy to help make your stay memorable!</p>
