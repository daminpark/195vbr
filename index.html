    <!-- DOMESTIC DIRECTIONS -->
    <section id="domestic-directions">
      <h2>🚶 DOMESTIC DIRECTIONS</h2>
      <p>We are a 7 minute walk from <strong>Victoria Station</strong>, a major rail, coach, and bus hub. You will find plenty of connections to this station (especially by coach – <a href="https://www.nationalexpress.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nationalexpress.com</a>).</p>
    </section>

    <!-- AIRPORT DIRECTIONS -->
    <section id="airport-directions">
      <h2>✈️ AIRPORT DIRECTIONS</h2>
      <p>You can book buses on <a href="https://www.nationalexpress.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nationalexpress.com</a>, and trains on <a href="https://www.thetrainline.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trainline.com</a>.</p>

      <p><strong>GATWICK:</strong><br>
      We recommend a train as it goes directly to Victoria – trains run every 10 minutes, takes 30 minutes, and costs around 15 pounds one way. You can tap in and tap out using a contactless card (no need to buy a ticket).<br>
      Please be aware the train goes to the South Terminal, and you must leave some more time to transfer to the North Terminal (around 15 minutes extra).</p>

      <p><strong>STANSTED:</strong><br>
      We recommend the train to Tottenham Hale, and change to the Victoria line to Victoria. Please be aware you cannot use contactless from Stansted – you must buy a ticket.</p>

      <p><strong>LUTON:</strong><br>
      We recommend the coach to Victoria. You can buy a ticket when you get out of the airport. Buses take 1h30, direct, comes every 30 minutes, costs 12 pounds one way.</p>

      <p><strong>HEATHROW:</strong><br>

    </section>

    <!-- GETTING AROUND -->
    <section id="getting-around">
      <h2>🚇 GETTING AROUND</h2>
      <p>You can pay for everything with a tap of a contactless credit/debit card. There is no need to get an “all-day” ticket to save money as it gets calculated at the end of the day and you get charged for the cheapest ticket.</p>
      <p>You can also take a public boat along the river!</p>
    </section>

    <!-- CHECK-IN & LUGGAGE DROP-OFF -->
    <section id="check-in-luggage">
      <h2>🧳 CHECK-IN &amp; LUGGAGE DROP-OFF</h2>
      <p>Check-in is from 15:00, and as it is self check-in anytime after that is okay with us. You can leave bags at the house from 11:00. You may store luggage downstairs in cupboard V. Please message me the day before check-in if you need an earlier dropoff before check-in (subject to availability).</p>
    </section>

    <!-- KITCHEN RULES -->
    <section id="kitchen-rules">
      <h2>🍳 KITCHEN (BASEMENT, DOOR MARKED K)</h2>
      <p>You have a food storage compartment and a fridge space with your room number on it. Anything that isn’t in your compartment or left after check-out time will be thrown away!</p>
      <p>The doors of the fridges are communal, and there is a dry communal compartment where you can store leftover dry food items.</p>
      <p>You can leave your dirty dishes in the dishwasher, the staff will turn this on when it's full.</p>
      <p>To clean the kitchen we provide disinfectant wipes.</p>
      <p>The big metal bin is for recycling (there are labels on the bin for what can go in). Liquid waste goes in the sink and solid food waste goes in the black bin, along with general waste.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- LAUNDRY -->
    <section id="laundry">
      <h2>🧺 LAUNDRY</h2>
      <p>We do not have any washing machines for guests. There is a coin launderette nearby we recommend called <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/uYuoqcrG3xC3Q2Nz8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">True Colours Launderette</a>.</p>
      <p>We do not change towels daily because we do not have the washing capacity to support this. However, if you would like a change of towels maximum once every two days, please leave them outside your door and we will replace them with fresh ones.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- TV -->
    <section id="tv">
      <h2>📺 TV</h2>
      <p>If any of Netflix, Apple TV, Amazon Prime are logged out or not working, please contact me and I should be able to log you in remotely.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- EARLY CHECK-IN -->
    <section id="early-check-in">
      <h2>⏰ EARLY CHECK-IN (PLEASE READ IF YOU REALLY NEED THIS)</h2>
      <p>Check-in is at 15:00, if you enter at this time, we guarantee the room is clean and your things will not be thrown away. The earliest you can enter your room/bathroom is at 12:00. HOWEVER, it is unlikely your room is ready by this time. If you see that the room is not ready/clean yet, please do not enter and please do not leave your things in there – the cleaners may throw away your things as they think the previous guests have left them, and will also mean the cleaners cannot do their job properly and result in an unclean room. Please do not store anything in the bathroom or kitchen before 15:00, as the cleaners empty out the fridge/food/bathroom compartments during the hours of 11:00–15:00.</p>
