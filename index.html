    <!-- DOMESTIC DIRECTIONS -->
    <section id="domestic-directions">
      <h2>🚶 Domestic directions</h2>
      <p><strong>By Train/Tube:</strong> We are ~7 minutes from <strong>London Victoria Station</strong>, a major hub for Underground, rail, and coaches. Exit Victoria toward Victoria Street/Vauxhall Bridge Road, turn left onto Vauxhall Bridge Road, and walk ~5–7 minutes. The house will be on your left.</p>
      <p><strong>By Coach:</strong> If arriving at Victoria Coach Station, it’s ~10 minutes on foot. Head east on Elizabeth Street toward Buckingham Palace Road, then go toward Victoria Station and onto Vauxhall Bridge Road.</p>
      <p><strong>By Car/Taxi:</strong> We do not have on-site parking. You may need a public parking garage (check <a href="https://en.parkopedia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Parkopedia</a>). Taxis/rideshares can use the postcode to find us.</p>

    <!-- AIRPORT DIRECTIONS -->
    <section id="airport-directions">
      <h2>✈️ Airport directions</h2>
      <p>Book buses at <a href="https://www.nationalexpress.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nationalexpress.com</a>, and trains at <a href="https://www.thetrainline.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trainline.com</a>. If traveling with 2+ people, a rideshare (Uber/Bolt) may be cheaper.</p>

      <p><strong>Gatwick (LGW):</strong><br>
      Take a train directly to Victoria (~30 minutes, ~£15). You can tap in/out with contactless. Consider Southern Rail instead of Gatwick Express (only ~5 minutes slower, much cheaper). Note: from the South Terminal, leave extra time to reach the North Terminal (15 more minutes).</p>

      <p><strong>Stansted (STN):</strong><br>
      Train to Tottenham Hale, then Victoria line to Victoria. You cannot use contactless from Stansted, so buy a ticket.</p>

      <p><strong>Luton (LTN):</strong><br>
      Train from Luton Airport Parkway to London St. Pancras (~40 minutes), then Victoria line to Victoria (~15 minutes). Coaches also run direct to Victoria Coach Station (~1h15m).</p>

      <p><strong>Heathrow (LHR):</strong><br>
      Piccadilly line (dark blue) from Heathrow, change at Hammersmith for District line (green) to Victoria (~50 minutes total).</p>
    </section>

    <!-- GETTING AROUND -->
    <section id="getting-around">
      <h2>🚇 Getting around</h2>
